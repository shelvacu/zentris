Zentris
=======

Zentris, a shortened version of Zen Tetris, is tetris with all stress removed. I'm still working on removing all of the stress.

Controls:

* WASD move around the screen
* Q/E rotate (counter)clockwise
* +/- increase/decrease speed
* SPACE pause/play (blocks can still be moved, but they stop falling)

Classic controls are also availible, use arrow keys, up rotates.

Play here: [zentris.shelvacu.com](http://zentris.shelvacu.com/)

NOTE: This does NOT require php. The file named "index.php" is for compatability with heroku. It's plain html. It may be played statically, but jQuery won't load correctly if accessed from a file:/// url.
