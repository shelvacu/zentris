Zentris
=======

Zentris, a shortened version of Zen Tetris, is tetris with all stress removed. I'm still working on removing all of the stress.

Controls:

* **WASD** move around the screen
* **Q** / **E** rotate (counter)clockwise
* **+** / **-** increase/decrease speed
* **P** pause/play (blocks can still be moved, but they stop falling)
* **R** "random" gives a new piece
* **SPACE** drop piece

Classic controls are also availible, use arrow keys, up rotates.

NOTE: This does NOT require php. The file named "index.php" is for compatability with heroku. It's plain html, and may be played statically.
