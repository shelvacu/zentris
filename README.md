Zentris
=======

Zentris, a shortened version of Zen Tetris, is tetris with all stress removed. Right now it's still kinda stressful, but speed can be increased or decreased (it never changes on its own), and blocks can be moved back up (I KNOW RIGHT).

Controls:
WASD - move around the screen
Q/E  - rotate (counter)clockwise
+/-  - increase/decrease speed

Play here: [zentris.shelvacu.com](http://zentris.shelvacu.com/)

NOTE: This does NOT require php. This is for compatability with heroku. It may be played statically, but jQuery won't load correctly if accessed from a file:/// url
